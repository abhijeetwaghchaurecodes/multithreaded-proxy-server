# multithreaded-proxy-server

This project is for intermediate level, we will learn a lot of stuff like:-
- How to IO at very low level using system calls
- How to use semaphores, wait, signal terminologies in programming
- How to use and what are sockets, TCP, UDP communication
- How threads are created, maintained and memory management
- Heap memory allocation and deallocation
- Using mutex locks while accessing a shared resource
- we will see LRU cache time based implementation

# HOW TO RUN?

    just compile the "Makefile" and you'll be provided with the object file to be run manually.
    ex. if the file is named as "proxy"

    command - ./proxy 8080

    here, 8080 is the port number generally used for WEB SERVERS.

    also run any query on INCOGNITO Mode, as today's browsers come up with their own built-in CACHE

    url query-- http://localhost:8080/https://www.coeptech.ac.in

    and you'll get the status on the TERMINAL.

    many good extensions are WELCOME.

    fork the repository and work on it :)
